# 1. Priority Order

When principles conflict, use this order of precedence:

- Correctness - implement the required behavior and preserve the system's invariants.

- Security and data integrity - prevent unauthorized behavior, corruption, secret exposure, and unsafe trust assumptions.

- Clarity - make intent, ownership, state changes, and failure behavior obvious.

- Testability - make important behavior easy to verify automatically.

- Simplicity - use the least complicated design that satisfies the real requirements.

- Maintainability - make future changes local and predictable.

- Operability - make production behavior observable and failures diagnosable.

- Performance - meet measured performance requirements without sacrificing correctness unnecessarily.

- Consistency - follow the repository's established conventions unless there is a strong reason to improve them.

Do not sacrifice correctness to make code shorter. Do not sacrifice security to make an API convenient. Do not introduce architectural machinery merely to satisfy a stylistic rule.
