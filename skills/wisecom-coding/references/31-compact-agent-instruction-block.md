# 31. Compact Agent Instruction Block

The following is a condensed version suitable for embedding directly into an AI coding-agent rule file.

Write code for correctness first, then security/data integrity, clarity, testability,
simplicity, maintainability, operability, performance, and consistency.

### Before editing:

- Read the requirement, nearby code, types, tests, config, and repository conventions.
- Identify the owning module, invariants, trust boundaries, side effects, failure modes,
  transaction/concurrency risks, and third-party dependencies.
- Make the smallest coherent change; do not redesign unrelated code.

### While coding:

- Use intention-revealing, pronounceable, searchable names.
- Do not use misleading type words, type prefixes, vague near-synonyms, or unnecessary
  abbreviations.
- Match name abstraction to context: domain names at high levels, mechanism names at
  low levels. Wider scope requires more descriptive names.
- Keep functions at one conceptual level and small enough to reason about locally.
- Prefer few, meaningful parameters; group related parameters when that makes call
  sites clearer. Do not apply an arbitrary parameter-count rule.
- Avoid boolean mode flags and hidden side effects. Make mutations explicit.
- Prefer queries that observe and commands that mutate unless an atomic combined
  contract is clearer.
- Keep high-level orchestration separate from low-level mechanics.
- Centralize true duplicated policy but do not abstract coincidentally similar code.
- Use data structures/DTOs when data is the purpose; use behavior-rich objects when
  invariants/behavior belong with the data. Choose OO vs data-oriented design based
  on the likely axis of change.
- Avoid deep object navigation and generic god classes/modules.
- Represent important states, units, and domain outcomes explicitly in types.
- Treat errors as part of the API. Use explicit results for expected business outcomes
  and appropriate exceptions/errors for exceptional/infrastructure failures.
- Define cleanup/resource lifetime with the happy path. Never swallow failures.
- Wrap volatile third-party APIs behind application-owned boundaries when that reduces
  coupling, translates errors, or improves testability.
- Validate all untrusted input at the trusted boundary, including semantic constraints.
- Enforce authorization independently of authentication.
- Parameterize SQL and other interpreters; never concatenate untrusted input into code.
- Never hard-code or log secrets. Never invent cryptography.
- Assume concurrency: protect read-modify-write invariants atomically.
- Make duplicate delivery/retries safe where needed. Retry only transient errors with
  bounded attempts/deadline, exponential backoff, jitter, and idempotency.
- Give remote work explicit timeout/cancellation behavior.
- Bound hostile/untrusted resource usage.
- Measure before complex optimization; avoid N+1 I/O and unbounded buffering.
- Add useful structured logs/metrics/traces at production-relevant boundaries without
  leaking secrets.
- Treat types as design constraints: make absence, finite states, identifiers, units, and
  expected failures explicit. Parse/validate external data before constructing trusted
  domain types. Prefer narrowing/proof over unchecked casts; contain dynamic/untyped values
  at boundaries. Static types never replace runtime validation of external data.
- Use the strictest useful compiler/type-checker mode. Do not silence type errors with broad
  escape hatches when the model can express the invariant safely.
- Scale the actual constrained dimension. Prefer a modular monolith and interchangeable
  instances until independent deployment/scaling/isolation justifies distribution. Identify
  bottlenecks before adding capacity; define backpressure, idempotency, data ownership,
  contract evolution, graceful shutdown, and observability before adding async/services.

### Comments:

- Prefer expressive code.
- Keep comments that explain why, warnings, external constraints, legal requirements,
  public API contracts, or actionable TODOs.
- Delete redundant, stale, misleading, decorative, historical, and commented-out code.

### Tests:

- Test observable behavior rather than private implementation details.
- Use Red/Green/Refactor where useful.
- Keep tests fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, and close to the behavior.
- Keep one concept per test; multiple assertions are fine when they prove that concept.
- Hide incidental setup with helpers/builders while keeping important values visible.
- Add regression tests for fixed bugs when practical.
- Use unit, integration, contract, and end-to-end tests at the appropriate boundaries.

### Before completion:

- Run formatter, linter, typecheck, relevant tests, build, and configured security checks.
- Inspect the final diff for accidental edits, debug output, stale comments, disabled
  tests, secrets, unsafe error handling, excessive API surface, and unrelated changes.
- Never claim a check passed unless it was actually run and observed.
