# Wisecom Coding

Treat coding as a verification loop, not text generation. Optimize for **local
reasoning**: a reader can understand behavior, effects, failures, and dependencies
without reconstructing hidden context from distant files.

Use this skill for implementation, bug fixes, refactoring, code review, and
architecture work. Translate examples into the strongest idiomatic mechanism in
the repository's language and ecosystem; no language, framework, vendor, or agent
is required.

## Priorities and rule strength

Existing repository invariants, architecture, tests, public contracts, and
documented conventions outrank generic stylistic guidance unless the task
explicitly changes them. A local bug fix is not permission to redesign the
surrounding architecture. Surface conflicting evidence or unsafe behavior rather
than silently rewriting contracts or weakening tests to fit a preferred design.

Resolve design conflicts in this order: correctness; security and data integrity;
clarity; testability; simplicity; maintainability; operability; performance;
consistency. Do not sacrifice correctness for brevity or security for convenience.
Do not introduce architecture merely to satisfy a stylistic rule.

MUST means required unless the task or existing architecture makes it impossible;
SHOULD is the default with concrete reasons for deviations; MAY is optional.
Name any impossible requirement and its consequence rather than silently skipping
it. These are engineering standards, not permission to override the user's task,
repository instructions, or the host agent's safety and tool constraints.

## Match depth to risk

Always inspect the local contract and affected callers, preserve repository
constraints, and run targeted checks. Choose depth by impact, not diff size:

| Change | Required depth |
| --- | --- |
| Trivial/local, with no sensitive behavior affected | Inspect the local contract and run targeted checks. No full chapter sweep, architecture analysis, or complete checklist. |
| Moderate behavioral change | Load relevant chapters, inspect and update behavioral tests where needed, and check applicable completion criteria. |
| Business-critical, stateful, or security-sensitive change | Load relevant chapters, perform a full failure-mode review of affected behavior, and review the complete definition of done. |

A one-line authorization or transaction change is not trivial. Escalate when
inspection reveals broader impact or uncertainty about invariants. Deeper review
still concerns the affected behavior, not unrelated distributed-system design.
These tiers govern the procedure and reference checklists below; they never waive
security, data integrity, or repository-required checks.

## Working procedure

1. **Understand.** Read the requirement, acceptance criteria, current implementation,
   callers, types, tests, configuration, and conventions. Find the owning module.
   Identify invariants, trust boundaries, side effects, expected outcomes, failure
   modes, concurrency, type guarantees, and relevant scale assumptions. Inspect
   unfamiliar APIs instead of guessing them.
2. **Design the smallest correct change.** Reuse existing patterns and boundaries.
   Define observable behavior, valid states, errors, resource lifetimes, and
   transaction guarantees. Preserve public behavior unless the task changes it.
   Do not invent extension points or redesign unrelated code.
3. **Protect behavior.** Use the existing test style. Capture important behavior
   and failure cases with a behavioral or characterization test where practical;
   reproduce bugs and keep useful regression coverage. Control external time,
   randomness, and network dependencies. Test contracts, not implementation trivia.
4. **Implement.** Use domain names, coherent functions, explicit mutation, and
   narrow ownership. Validate untrusted data at trusted boundaries; authorize
   sensitive operations. Preserve cleanup and atomic invariants. Distinguish
   domain outcomes from infrastructure failures. Bound resources and remote work;
   establish idempotency before retrying effects. Add useful, secret-safe telemetry
   where failures would otherwise be opaque.
5. **Refactor.** Once behavior is protected, improve names and reading flow,
   separate mixed abstraction levels, remove true duplicated policy and obsolete
   code, and reduce needless nesting and public surface. Do not abstract unrelated
   policies just because their code looks similar.
6. **Verify.** Run available, relevant formatting, lint, type, unit/integration,
   build, and configured security checks. Inspect the change for accidental edits,
   debug output, stale comments, disabled tests, secrets, unhandled errors,
   unnecessary dependencies, and unrelated churn. Never weaken checks to hide a bug.
7. **Check production failure behavior.** For business-critical, stateful, or
   security-sensitive work, consider
   timeout, duplicate execution, concurrent workers, process death halfway through,
   hostile input, unexpected dependency responses, diagnostics, secret exposure,
   and cross-user/tenant access. Return truthful outcomes, including partial failure.

## Loading the complete playbook

The references are the full standard, not optional summaries. At task start read
[the operating procedure](references/03-ai-coding-agent-operating-procedure.md)
and [the compact instruction block](references/31-compact-agent-instruction-block.md).
Then apply the risk tiers above. Trivial/local changes need no additional chapter
loading unless inspection exposes a relevant uncertainty. For moderate and
high-risk changes, read every relevant chapter, including its caveats and examples.
A retrying payment operation needs contracts, errors, security, concurrency,
typing, tests, and observability—not just the chapter matching its headline.

For non-trivial work use [the seven-phase workflow](references/29-end-to-end-implementation-workflow.md)
at the selected depth. Consult [the decision rules](references/28-explicit-decision-rules-for-coding-agents.md)
when a design or review question calls for them. Use applicable sections of
[the definition of done](references/30-definition-of-done-checklist.md) for moderate
changes and review the full checklist for high-risk changes. Report relevant
checks that were unavailable rather than assuming they passed.

All paths below are relative to this installed skill directory, not the target
repository. Read them with the host agent's file tools. Load details on demand,
not the entire playbook for every small task.

## Policy and enforcement

- **Skill = reasoning policy.** Instructions guide decisions; they do not enforce them.
- **Repository rules = project-specific constraints.** Local contracts, commands,
  architecture, and documented conventions define what this project requires.
- **CI/tooling = enforcement.** Use the repository's existing checks and required
  merge gates to make mechanically checkable requirements block bad merges.

Inspect configured checks relevant to the change and run their documented commands.
Type checks, lint, and tests should be required CI checks where the project uses
them; secret scanning can block detected credentials. Review requirements and
coverage/diff tooling can flag removed tests, weakened assertions, or coverage
regressions, but cannot prove that tests still protect the intended behavior.
Passing automation is not a substitute for contract review.

Do not disable checks, lower thresholds, or bypass merge gates to make a change
pass. Report missing enforcement or unobserved CI results explicitly. Reuse existing
tooling; add or change enforcement only when the task calls for it. Installing
this skill does not install hooks, configure CI, or enable branch protection.

## Completion report

State what changed, the checks actually run and their observed results, and any
remaining limitations or unverified assumptions. Never claim compilation, passing
tests, command success, or production safety without evidence. Keep the report
proportional to the task.
